# The scripts I wrote for newsletter

## autoformatter folder

Haha don't even try to muck with it I barely know how it works
Put the pbs into their respective txt files
Here's some examples

*pcpbs.txt*

cringemoment 326 0

some_noob 2 1


The first argument is the username, the second is the amount, the third is what game (0 = Jstris, 1 = TETR.IO)

*ppbultra.txt*

cringemoment 476 0 @140

jimothyjimothy 2 0 @175

The first argument is the username, the second is the amount, the third is what game (0 = Jstris, 1 = TETR.IO), the fourth is the piece count
### DO NOT PUT FOURTH ARGUMENT FOR ANYTHING THAT YOU DON'T WANT THE FOURTH ARGUMENT PRINTED
